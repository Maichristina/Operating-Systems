Project1
Implementation of multithreaded operation in a data storage engine
Initially, we were asked to provide a straightforward implementation using a lock to enforce mutual exclusion in the put and get operations. The goal was to allow multiple threads to perform put and get without causing conflicts in the data structures or segmentation faults.
Project2
Implementation of a log file in the Linux FAT file system
